Standardization
===============================================================================


The `W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group <https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/>`_ was created in 2015 to advocate standardization of the :ref:`timingobject` as the core part of a much needed timing model for the Web. 
As part of this initiative, a the `Timing Object Draft Specification <http://webtiming.github.io/timingobject/>`_ was published, and `timingsrc <https://github.com/webtiming/timingsrc/>`_ was created as a reference implementaion of the proposal. 

Since then, the Multi-device Timing Community Group has been included within the scope of the `Media and Entertainment Interest Group <https://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/>`_, responsible for standardization of Web technologies related to media. The *Multi-device Timing Community Group* is included in the
`roadmap <https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/media/>`_ document of the interest group. Beyond this, the *Media and Entertainment Interest Group* have not shown much interest in addressing the need for a timing model on the Web, though the gap appears to be pretty significant (see: :ref:`intro`).

In the mean time, the **timingsrc** JavaScript implementation has been maturing through steady use. It is seeing increased usage from Web programmers around the world, not least after Corona. It seems the boost of online activity is making the growing issues of synchronization and consistency even more evident.

The `Timing Object Draft Specification <http://webtiming.github.io/timingobject/>`_ has not been updated since its original publications, so deviations made by the **timingsrc** implementation have yet not been included.
